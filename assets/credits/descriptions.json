  "film1": "*Once Uppon a Puppet* video game was all about building a slick, headache-free animation pipeline—from rigging all the way to seeing the characters bust moves in Unity. I rigged 10 unique characters (each with their own personality quirks) and whipped up 20+ mix-and-match NPC costumes. The goal? Make it easy for animators to do their magic and have everything play nice in-game. 

Key stuff I dove into:
* Led and backed up the animation crew to keep things consistent and polished—no janky elbows on my watch.
* Chatted regularly with game designers to make sure our animations *felt* right—snappy, responsive, and natural.
* Basically Frankenstein’d the animation pipeline from scratch, tuned it up, and made sure it didn’t explode under pressure.",

  "film2": "On the SnowQueen movie, I teamed up with the Animation Lead and followed their vision to animate 8 to 12 seconds a week. It was all about quality over quantity—and making sure every blink, breath, and eyebrow raise hit the mark.",

  "film3": "*Tom and Friends* was a sprint-marathon hybrid. I worked closely with the Animation Lead to crank out 10 to 15 seconds of animation each week. It was like being on a creative treadmill—with great feedback and the occasional bug-fueled adrenaline rush.",

  "film4": "*Salma’s Big Wish* was special. My first feature film that really meant something to me—it had heart. I stepped into the Lead Animator role here—aka wrangler of a small but mighty team of four animators. My job was to make sure everything looked amazing and stayed aligned with the director’s vision. Lots of teamwork, feedback, and making sure no one rage-quit after a review session."
